                        I’m 24, currently living in Denver, but I grew up all over the Southeast U.S.. I initially started college with the intention to attend medical afterward, but I changed my mind quite late——senior year. Therefore, when I graduated I was a bit lost. I traveled for about six months before joining the Peace Corps and committing my next two years of life to teaching English in Ecuador. In January of 2020, I sold or stored everything not absolutely necessary and moved my life to Ecuador. Three short months later, the pandemic plagued the world and I was evacuated back to the states. Again lost, I was led to remember my roots. I'm the type of person who likes to build and create and has a natural knack for problem solving. I've also always had a natural facility for technology——and specifically computers——so when faced with whether to change my career path or not, I chose to delve further into my natural curiosities and talents. I enrolled in UCLA Coding Bootcamp and learned full-stack web development. Having never coded prior, this was quite a challenge. Nonetheless, I have no regrets and I hope to explore this new world with my new skills.
